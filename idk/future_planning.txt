maybe -1 will be a rest in a melody?

put things into folders?

something for tonal things, eventually when i want to handle those sort of things better

fix the midiwrite to handle meta events too, and also the insert track? should work, and have an insert meta method for tracks

implement midi track type 1 so i can have multiple simultaneous tracks. so it would be midiwrite([tracks]). also midi channels, and all the other info im throwing out from the midi files

have a file for translating between "notes" and frequencies, maybe pitch, cents to frequency. in mappings?
  so maybe that could allow for the 19 tone equal temprament.
    and then maybe learn how wav files work, to create those.

allow plugging in floats for more things, always go to int but don't restrict the inputs

live midi input? that's gotta be possible somehow
